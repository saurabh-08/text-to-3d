# Connecting to Your Ubuntu SSH Server

This guide will walk you through the steps to connect to the Ubuntu SSH server I have provisioned.

## System Specifications
```
---------------------------------------------------------------
|  CPU     : AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D (8-core, 4.2 GHz, Zen 4)      |
|  GPU     : NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090, 24 GB VRAM               |
|  Memory  : 64 GB RAM                                         |
|  Storage : 2 TB SSD                                          |
|  OS      : Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS                                |
---------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Prerequisites

- **SSH Client**: Ensure you have an SSH client installed. Most Linux and macOS systems come with SSH pre-installed. Windows users can use tools like **PuTTY** or the built-in **OpenSSH** client (available on Windows 10 and later).
- **Credentials**: Contact the owner to obtain necessary credentials.
- **VPN Network Access**: [Request here](https://login.tailscale.com/uinv/i05bd69e23b391775)

## Steps to Connect

### 1. Connect to Tailscale VPN

Make sure you are connected to Tailscale VPN.

### 2. Open Terminal or SSH Client

On macOS or Linux, open the Terminal application. On Windows, either open **Command Prompt**, **PowerShell**, or **PuTTY** (if installed).

### 3. Connect Using SSH

To connect using your username and IP address, run the following command:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 username@100.111.139.62
```

Replace `username` with your actual username.

### 4. Enter Password

SSH will now prompt you to enter the password. Type your password and press **Enter**.

> Note: When entering your password, you won't see any characters. This is a security feature.

### 5. Accept the Server's Fingerprint

On your first connection, SSH will ask you to confirm the server's fingerprint. Type `yes` and press **Enter** to add the server to your known hosts file.

```plaintext
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
```

### 6. Successful Connection

If everything is correct, you will now be connected to your Ubuntu server. You should see a command prompt for the server, which might look something like this:

```plaintext
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-26-generic x86_64)
ubuntu@your_server_ip:~$
```

## Additional Tips

- **Transfer Files Using SCP**: To copy files to or from the server, use `scp` (Secure Copy Protocol). Here’s an example of copying a file from your local machine to the server:

  ```bash
  scp /path/to/local/file username@your_server_ip:/path/to/remote/directory
  ```

- **Exit the SSH Session**: When you’re done, type `exit` and press **Enter** to close the SSH connection.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Timeout**: If you can’t connect, ensure the vpn is connected, the credentials are correct, and that your network allows SSH connections (port 2222).
- **Permission Denied**: This error typically means your username or password. Double-check the credentials.
- **Firewall Settings**: Ensure the client's firewall allows outbound SSH connections.
